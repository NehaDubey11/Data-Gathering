If the interiors of the kitchen allow then one must place the gas hob exactly in the south-east corner and the cook should be facing east. Kitchen slab should either be white                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            off-white   ivory or any other lighter shade. Never go for a black   green   blue or dark brown colour of countertop.Fridge   microwave and toaster should be placed in the north-west side of the kitchen. South and west side should be for the cupboards and for storing pulses   wheat   rice. Cylinders should be stacked up in the southern side. Dishwasher   water purifier and sink should be on the eastern or northern walls   with fewer cupboards. Kitchen in south-east should generally be painted white and cupboards can have a combination of white   off-white and red. However red is to be kept at the minimum.Vastu offers directions for storing different kitchen appliances as well. Photo credit: Creatv Eight/Unsplash\n",
      "0                                Which Direction is the Best to Build a House?As per vastu shastra                                                                                                                                      east   north-east and north are the best directions for your house. However                                                                                                                                                                                                                     there are many other things to it than just following these directions blindly. Having an east or north facing house is a good idea for northern region   but replicating the same principle of architecture in north-eastern region would be a mistake. West or south facing premises are recommended for north-eastern regions. It is best to consult a vastu expert to get the best advice for your home.ALSO READ:Vastu tips for the balcony and terrace                                                      NaN     NaN                                              NaN                                                                                                                                                    NaN     NaN                                                                     NaN                                                                  NaN                                                                                                                           NaN                                                                                                                                                                         NaN\n"
