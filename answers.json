The ancient Hindu science believes that the placement of your tijori or cash drawer can either multiply or deplete your financial assets. A Vastukar usually plots your property's wealth corner and ask you to store your wallet, jewellery, valuables and financial documents in that corner only, to manifest abundance.�Having the locker placed in the right direction is of utmost importance, if the locker placement is not correct, chances are there will be more losses than accumulation of money, or possibility of theft,� says Vastukar Neeta Sinha from Mumbai-based AstroArchitecture. �But this can be rectified easily just by balancing the energy of the space, by creating a wealth corner in the right direction,� she continues. She offers a few tips to get the money tap flowing:As per traditional Vastu, the safe should be placed in the south west corner of the house, and the locker�s door should be towards north, dedicated to Kuber, the Hindu god of Wealth. �But this is not always possible with contemporary architecture, for logistical reasons,� Sinha says.�Ensure that the safe is always placed in a private space, like the bedroom or dressing room, inaccessible to guests or visitors,� Sinha says.Also read: 18 vastu tips to create a serene bedroomThe safe should be places in a way that it helps attract and not lose moneyAs with everything else, keep the area clean and clutter-free. Clutter and dirt can cause major energy depletion. �Unlike many spiritualities that preach monasticism, wealth has a sacred position in Indian culture, and to receive blessings in the form of abundance from our gods, we have always maintained cleanliness as a gesture to show respect,� Sinha says.She advises against placing the safe in the store room, or the kitchen. Never place a safe or cash box under a beam, in your home or office, as the area under is considered unstable, thus making it a negative space for most human activities, according to Vastu Shastra.Line the interiors of your safe with a red, a stimulating colour, before keeping any valuables inside, much like the lining of a jewel box. Then, add a few bright yellow accents, the colour of prosperity, on the exteriors. The colour combination will make your safe a money magnet!Also read: 8 vastu tips to set up a home officeAt any point of time, your cash drawer, money box or safe should not be completely empty as that symbolizes lack. �Even in the worst of times, at least leave a single coin inside, even if you have removed all other valuables,� Sinha points out. �It will open doors to opportunity,� she adds.One should ring temple bells and light incense around the area of the locker at least once a day to keep the �flow� circulating and dispel any stagnant energy. �Just like Indian merchants do at the start of the day, at their galas or workshops,� Sinha concludes.Also read: 6 vastu tips for placing mirrors in your homeBy Nolan LewisBy Nolan LewisBy AD StaffBy Pooja Khanna TyagiConnect With ADAssociated Sites� 2022 Cond� Nast.

          "context": "According to vastu, the direction that a person faces when sleeping plays a key role in determining the quality of sleep. The headboard should always be placed towards the east or the south so that one’s legs point towards the north or west.Position the bed in the centre of the bedroom so that there is adequate circulation space around it. Avoid placing the bed in the corner of the room or directly under a beam.The southwest or northwest zones of the bedroom are ideal for placing heavy furniture like the wardrobes. The locker should be installed on the southern wall so that it opens in the northern direction.The dressing table mirror should be strategically positioned so that it does not reflect the bed. Therefore the ideal position is next to the side table of the bed.The study desk or workstation should be positioned such that one faces the north or east direction while working.Ideally, one should avoid keeping a TV in the bedroom as that could cause disturbed sleep. However if one chooses to do so, then place the TV in the southeast zone.Colour of the BedroomEarthy colours evoke nature in the bedroom\nChoose soothing colours such as off-white, cream, sky blue, green, purple or pink.Shades of brown evoke nature and help one to stay grounded.The children’s bedroom should include hues of green and yellow to bring a bright and cheerful vibe. However, too many colours can be distracting.Avoid dark maroon or red for the bedroom as they can exacerbate stress.Bedroom DecorIncorporate built-in storage so that the bedroom is clean and clutter-free.Artwork and photographs can influence one’s mental state. Choose ones with positive themes and place them such that they are visible immediately upon entering the bedroom.Decorate with fresh flowers as their fragrance brings a positive vibe to the bedroom.The bedroom should be well-illuminated but not too bright or dim. This can be achieved by bringing in a layered lighting scheme which is a perfect combination of task lighting, ambient lighting and accent lighting.",

But as per vastu, there is another functionality to mirrors—if placed correctly, they can change the energy of a home. Mirrors have the power to attract positivity and reflect or reject negative energies. They can revert vastu flaws, just with their correct placement. Here are some rules to placing mirrors in your homes, as per Vastu Shashtra.Directional Placement of MirrorsMirrors should always be placed on the eastern and northern walls of the house and never on southern or western walls.Suitable AreasOther than the dressing room and washroom, mirrors can be placed in the dining area, right opposite the dining table, so that while having meals, the entire family is reflected in the mirror. As per vastu, this brings prosperity, enhances love and affection between the family members.Shapes are ImportantSquare and rectangular shapes are preferred in vastu shastra as they spread energies evenly. Oval and circles are not considered the best and should be avoided. Although there is no restriction on the size of the mirror to be used, any irregular shape should be avoided.According to vastu, circular mirrors are not a preferred shape. Photo credit: Minh Pham/Unsplash\nImprove WealthPlacing a mirror inside your locker can help improve your wealth. Ensure that the mirror is one piece and does not show a distorted image of the locker or things kept inside.Keep it CleanWherever you place a mirror, make sure that it is kept absolutely clean and spotless. Do not stick anything on the reflective surface like stickers or bindis.Mirrors in the BedroomMaster bedroom should be in the south or southwest direction, which is dominated by earth element. Whereas, mirror is water element and is associated with instability. As per vastu, it is not advisable to place a mirror in this room as it will interfere with the energies of earth element and create chaos.ALSO READ:Top 5 vastu questions answered by an expert vastukar",
